## Lessons Learned

Labor is easy. Class is so basic and cut marks on things that you need a lot of practice to do so, and thankfully why they teach you and the things they prioritize, you would end up not needing to use it because you would be crushed by getting bad grades on things, you actually don't need to focus on how things work, not on memorizing the exact procedure of how it is done by hand. People used to do it by hand because there wasn't much to learn, but now there's a world to catch up to, and it's slow and stuck at a slow pace where the core matters, but they focus on what they can grade you on.
